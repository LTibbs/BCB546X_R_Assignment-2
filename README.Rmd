## Data Inspection

First I need to read in the data and briefly look over the structure of the datasets
```{r reading in data}
genotypes_raw<-read.delim("fang_et_al_genotypes.txt", header = T, sep = "\t")
dim(genotypes_raw)
head(genotypes_raw[,1:5]) # just showing the output of first five columns for all of these inspections because there are a ton of columns..
tail(genotypes_raw[,1:5])
# str(genotypes_raw) output is pretty long
snp_pos<-read.delim("snp_position.txt", header = T, sep = "\t")
dim(snp_pos)
head(snp_pos[,1:5])
tail(snp_pos[,1:5])
# str(snp_pos)
```
